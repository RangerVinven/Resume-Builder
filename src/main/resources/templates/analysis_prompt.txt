- Required or preferred programming languages, frameworks, or tools
- Spoken or written language requirements (e.g., English fluency, bilingual roles)
- Certifications, qualifications, or degrees mentioned
- Years of experience or seniority level expected
- Cultural or team values (e.g., family-oriented, results-driven, inclusive, startup-like, high-performance)
- Job type and structure (e.g., full-time, contract, hybrid, remote, on-site)
- Any industry or domain focus (e.g., healthcare, fintech, education)
- Anything else that contributes to a holistic picture of the role and ideal candidate
