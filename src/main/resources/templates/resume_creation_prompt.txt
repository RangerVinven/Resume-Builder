You are given two inputs:

1. The analysis of the job description in JSON format
2. The master file containing a person's information, with sections surrounded by ===, including work experience, skills, languages, certificates, etc.

Your task:

- Select the most relevant items from the master file that match the job requirements.
- Include multiple items if they are all relevant (you don't need to include all the items, only the relevant ones).
- Strictly do not modify, paraphrase, or invent anything - only use what is in the master file. Everything should be copied verbatim, without any alteration.
- Make sure to include sections for anything implied by the job description.
- Include the personal information and personal statement unless otherwise instructed. Only include one personal statement.
- Output in the provided YAML format, exactly matching the exampleâ€™s keys. Use double quotes for all strings. Do not include any text other than the YAML file.
