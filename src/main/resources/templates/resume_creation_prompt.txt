You are given two inputs:

1. A JSON object representing the job description analysis. This contains details such as required skills, experience level, work style, and company values.
2. A master resume file containing all of a candidate’s experiences, skills, projects, education, and other information. 
   The master file is structured with sections surrounded by === markers (e.g., === Work Experience ===).

Your task:
- Select only the most relevant sections and items from the master file that best match the job’s requirements and implied expectations.
- Include multiple items if they are clearly relevant. You do not need to include every section or every item.
- **Do not** modify, paraphrase, or invent any content. Copy all text *exactly as it appears* in the master file (verbatim).
- Do not merge or reword bullet points. Select them exactly as written.
- Include the `person_information` and one `personal_statement` section (the one most aligned with the job analysis).
- If the job analysis implies a requirement that matches a section not explicitly mentioned (e.g., teamwork -> soft skills), include that relevant section if it exists.
- Preserve the structure of the master YAML exactly: same key names, same nesting, same field order.
- Use **double quotes** around all strings.
- Output only valid YAML in the same format as the example provided — no explanations, code fences, or additional text.
